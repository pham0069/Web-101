/*
    'float' property is used for positioning and formatting content in its container
    e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

    It can take the following values:

        left - The element floats to the left of its container
        right - The element floats to the right of its container
        none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
        inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent

    
*/

/* Make image element to float to the right of the container */
img {
    float: right;
}

/*
    'clear' property specifies what should happen with the element that is NEXT TO a floating element.

    It the following values:
        none - The element is NOT pushed BELOW left or right floated elements. This is default
        left - The element is pushed below left floated elements
        right - The element is pushed below right floated elements
        both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements
        inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent

    When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: 
        If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. 
    Your floated element will continue to float, 
    but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.
