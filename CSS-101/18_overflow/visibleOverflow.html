<!--
    'overflow' property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars 
    when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

    It can take the following values:

        visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
        hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
        scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
        auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

    this property only works for block elements with a specified height
