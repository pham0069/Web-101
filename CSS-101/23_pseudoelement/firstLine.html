    <p>You can use the ::first-line pseudo-element to add a special effect to the first line of a text. Some more text.
        And even more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and
        more, and more.</p>
    <p>::first-line versus :first-line
    <br> The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. 
    This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.</p>
