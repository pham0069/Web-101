    The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element 
    (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).

    An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
    
    If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, 
    the element positioned last in the HTML code will be shown on top.
