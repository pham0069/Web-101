<!--
    'position' property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element 
    
    it can take 5 values
        static
        relative
        fixed
        absolute
        sticky

    Elements are then positioned using the properties: 
        top
        bottom
        left
        right
        
    These properties will not work unless the position property is set first. 
    They also work differently depending on the position value.
