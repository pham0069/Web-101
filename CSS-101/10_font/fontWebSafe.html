    Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices.
    However, there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. 
    There is always a chance that a font is not found or is not installed properly.
    Therefore, it is very important to always use fallback fonts.

    This means that you should add a list of similar "backup fonts" in the font-family property. 
    If the first font does not work, the browser will try the next one, and the next one, and so on. 
    Always end the list with a generic font family name.

    The following list is best web safe for HTML and CSS
        san-serif: 
            Arial               most widely used, safest, available on major OS
            Verdana             popular, readable even for small size
            Helvetica           loved by designers, suitable for many business
            Tahoma              less space btw characters
            Trebuchet MS        not supported by all mobile OS
        serif: 
            Times New Roman     look professional, often used in news/magazines website
            Georgia             elegant, redablee in small size, used for mobile
