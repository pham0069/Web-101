            3. External style sheets (in the head section)

        - body background color is defined in inline style (lavender), internal (linen), external (lightblue)
        inline takes effect -> background color = lavender

        - h1 text color is defined in internal (purple), external (navy)
        internal takes effect -> text color of heading = purple

        - p text color is only defined in external (olive)
        
        - font family is defined nowhere -> default browser is Times New Roman

        <p>Here, the background color of the page is set with inline CSS, and also with an internal CSS, and also with an external CSS.</p>
        <p>Try experimenting by removing styles to see how the cascading stylesheets work (try removing the inline CSS first, then the internal, then the external).</p>
